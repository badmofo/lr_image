LR_IMAGE

LR_IMAGE is a minimalistic image library written in C.

It was written in a fit or rage inspired by the ImageMagick library.

Look within lr_image.h for documentation.

This code depends the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG library
available at http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz 

Licensing terms are explained in the LICENSE file.

In theory this library should compile under windows, but the
included Makefile is for Unix.  Lemme know if you try.
