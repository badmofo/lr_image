LR_IMAGE is a minimalistic image library written in C.

It was written in a fit or rage inspired by the ImageMagick library.

Look within lr_image.h for documentation.

Included are a few command line sample programs.

  thumb - thumbnail a jpeg to a 200x200 or 100x100 gif
  equalize - perform histogram equalization on a jpeg
  block - montage a bunch of gif thumbnails

This code depends the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG library
available at http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz 

Licensing terms are explained in the LICENSE file.

In theory this library should compile under windows, but the
included Makefile is for Unix.  Lemme know if you try.
