LR_IMAGE is a minimalistic image library written in C.

It was written in a fit or rage inspired by the ImageMagick library.

Look within lr_image.h for documentation.

Included are a few command line sample programs.

  thumb - thumbnail a jpeg to a 200x200 or 100x100 gif
  equalize - perform histogram equalization on a jpeg
  block - montage a bunch of gif thumbnails

Just need to run 'make' to build the static library and sample programs.

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

# yum install libjpeg-devel libpng-devel popt-devel
